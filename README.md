## ðŸ§© About

This repository contains Python scripts and mini-apps that show how to work with PostgreSQL from Python: connecting, querying, updating, handling transactions, etc.  
Itâ€™s structured so you can explore each concept in a modular way.

These examples are based on the **The Complete Python/PostgreSQL Course 2.0**, and aim to help reinforce the concepts through hands-on code.
